# Introduction to ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics

## What is ROS 2?

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is a flexible framework for writing robotic software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robotic behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

## Why ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics?

ROS 2 provides several key advantages for humanoid robotics development:

- **Modularity**: Components can be developed and tested independently
- **Reusability**: Common robotic functions are packaged as reusable modules
- **Community**: Large community with extensive documentation and packages
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Interfaces with various sensors and actuators
- **Communication**: Robust message passing between components

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous goal-oriented communication
- **Packages**: Software containers for organizing code
- **Launch files**: Configuration files to start multiple nodes at once

## Getting Started

In this module, we'll explore how to set up ROS 2 for humanoid robotics, create custom nodes for controlling humanoid robots, and implement communication patterns specific to humanoid applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Programming experience in C++ or Python
