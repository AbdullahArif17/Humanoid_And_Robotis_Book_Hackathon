# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This comprehensive resource covers the cutting-edge field of humanoid robotics, combining artificial intelligence with physical systems to create robots that can interact with the world in human-like ways.

## What You'll Learn

This book is organized into four comprehensive modules:

### Module 1: ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics
- Master the Robot Operating System 2 framework
- Learn to build and control humanoid robots
- Implement communication patterns specific to humanoid applications

### Module 2: Gazebo & Unity for Humanoid Simulation
- Create realistic simulations for humanoid robots
- Test algorithms in safe, controlled environments
- Leverage both physics-based and graphics-based simulation

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac for Humanoid AI
- Implement AI capabilities using NVIDIA's robotics platform
- Leverage GPU acceleration for real-time processing
- Build perception and navigation systems

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action for Humanoid Robotics
- Integrate vision, language, and action for advanced capabilities
- Enable natural human-robot interaction
- Implement embodied AI systems

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Robotics engineers and researchers
- AI/ML practitioners working in robotics
- Computer science students and professionals
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and physical systems

## How to Use This Book

Each module builds upon the previous ones, but can also be read independently based on your interests. We recommend following the modules sequentially for the complete learning experience.

The book includes practical examples, code snippets, and exercises to reinforce your learning. Many sections include links to relevant research papers and additional resources.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python/C++)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with robotics concepts (optional but helpful)
