# Introduction to Gazebo & Unity for Humanoid Simulation

## What is Humanoid Simulation?

Simulation is a critical component in humanoid robotics development, allowing developers to test algorithms, validate control strategies, and train AI models in a safe, controlled environment before deploying to physical robots.

## Gazebo vs Unity for Humanoid Robotics

Both Gazebo and Unity offer powerful simulation capabilities for humanoid robotics, each with distinct advantages:

### Gazebo
- Physics-based simulation with realistic dynamics
- Tight integration with ROS/ROS 2
- Open-source with extensive community support
- Specialized for robotics applications
- Accurate physics engine for control validation

### Unity
- High-quality graphics and visualization
- Advanced rendering capabilities
- Machine learning integration through ML-Agents
- Cross-platform deployment
- VR/AR support for immersive testing

## Key Simulation Concepts

- **Physics Engines**: Accurate modeling of forces, collisions, and dynamics
- **Sensors**: Simulation of cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors, etc.
- **Actuators**: Modeling of motors, servos, and other actuators
- **Environment**: Creation of realistic environments for testing
- **Scenarios**: Predefined situations for testing specific capabilities

## Getting Started

In this module, we'll explore how to set up both Gazebo and Unity environments for humanoid robotics simulation, create humanoid robot models, and implement realistic physics and sensor simulation.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics simulation concepts
- Experience with 3D modeling or CAD software
- Familiarity with ROS/ROS 2 (for Gazebo)
- Basic understanding of game engines (for Unity)
